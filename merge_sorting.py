# I DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S NAMED MERGE SORT, WHEN IN ACTUALITY, IT'S DIVIDE SORT FIRST.

# -------------------- Merge Sort Explanation --------------------
# Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that recursively splits the array 
# into smaller halves, sorts them, and then merges them back together in sorted order.
# This ensures an efficient and stable sorting mechanism.

# ðŸ”¹ Time Complexity:
# - Worst, Best & Average Case: O(n log n) â†’ Consistent efficiency across all cases.
# - Space Complexity: O(n) â†’ Requires additional memory for merging sorted halves.

# -------------------- Merge Sort Implementation --------------------
